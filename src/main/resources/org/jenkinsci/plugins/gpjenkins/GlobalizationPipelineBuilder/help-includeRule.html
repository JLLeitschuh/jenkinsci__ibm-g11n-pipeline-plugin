	<ul>
		<li>Base Directory : src/MyResources</li>
		<li>Include Rule : **/*.json</li>
		<li>Exclude Rule : **/config.json</li>
	</ul>
	will includes all *.json files under
	<samp>src/MyResources</samp>
	directory of your Jenkins workspace, but excludes all files with file
	name
	<samp>config.json</samp>
	.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Upload:</b> Uploads source files in Base Directory filtred
			through Include and Exclude Rule to IBM GLobalization Pipeline
			instance.</li>
		<li><b>Download:</b> Downloads bundles from your instance of IBM
			Globalization Pipeline to Jenkins job workspace that matches the
			source files found from Base Directory filtered through Include and
			Exclude rule</li>
	</ul>
