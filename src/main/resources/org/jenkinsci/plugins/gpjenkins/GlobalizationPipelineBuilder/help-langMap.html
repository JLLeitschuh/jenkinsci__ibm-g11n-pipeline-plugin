	<h4>
		For <span style="color: red">Upload and Download</span> goal
	</h4>
	<p>
		A JSON representation of key:value pairs<br />where each Key is is a <a
			href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47" target="_blank">BCP 47
			language tag</a> used by Globalization Pipeline service instance. And the
		element Value is a language ID used for output resource file or path
		name.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Upload:</b> Uploads goal is only concerned about the Key
			of the json. Those are the target languages you want to choose for
			your source files to be translated in.</li>
		<br />
		<p>For example</p>
		<samp>
			{ <span style="color: red">"de"</span>:"I am", <span
				style="color: red">"es"</span>:"Not affected", <span
				style="color: red">"fr"</span>:"by upload goal" }
		</samp>
		<p>will upload your source files to IBM Globalization Pipeline for
			translation in German, Spanish and French.</p>
		<li><b>Download:</b> Downloads goal is concerned about both Key
			and Value of the json. Keys are the target languages you want to
			choose for downloading your translated files from Globalization
			Pipeline to Jenkin's output Directory. Values are the language ID
			used for output resource file or path name</li>
		<br />
		<p>For example</p>
		<samp> { "de":"de", "es":"Spanish", "fr":"Parth" } </samp>
		<p>
			will download translated files from IBM Globalization Pipeline for
			translation in German, Spanish and French with file name<br />
			&lt;filename&gt;&lt;BCP47 formatting&gt;de.&lt;type&gt;<br />
			&lt;filename&gt;&lt;BCP47 formatting&gt;Spanish.&lt;type&gt;<br />
			&lt;filename&gt;&lt;BCP47 formatting&gt;Parth.&lt;type&gt;<br /> same
			naming rules are mapped for output directory creation if you chose
			LANGUAGE_DIR or LANGUAGE_SUBDIR in Download goal's output layout
		</p>

	</ul>
	<p>Note that in download goal, if Key (target language you opt for
		downloading in Jenkins workspace) is not set in Globalization Pipeline
		through upload goal or manually by UI dashbaord, those target
		languages won't be downloaded.</p>
