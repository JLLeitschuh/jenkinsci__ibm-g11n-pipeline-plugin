	<p>Specifies one of following keywords to control how download goal
		generates the contents of translated resource bundle files.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>MERGE_TO_SOURCE:</b> Duplicates the contents of the source
			bundle and replaces only translated resource strings. This option
			might not be implemented by some format types. In this case,
			TRANSLATED_WITH_FALLBACK is used instead.</li>
		<li><b>TRANSLATED_WITH_FALLBACK:</b> Emits only resource strings
			(with a simple header if applicable). When translated string value is
			not available, the value in the source language is used.</li>
		<li><b>TRANSLATED_ONLY:</b> Emits only resource strings (with a
			simple header if applicable). When translated string value is not
			available, do not include the key in the output.</li>
		<li><b>MERGE_REVIEWED_TO_SOURCE:</b> Duplicate the contents of
			the source bundle and replaces only translated resource strings
			marked as reviewed. This option might not be implemented by some
			format types. In this case, REVIEWED_WITH_FALLBACK is used instead.</li>
		<li><b>REVIEWED_WITH_FALLBACK:</b> Emits only resource strings
			marked as reviewed. When translated string value is not available, or
			not marked as reviewed, the value in the source language is used.</li>
		<li><b>REVIEWED_ONLY:</b> Emits only resource strings marked as
			reviewed. When translated string value is not available, or
			translated not marked as reviewed, do not include the key in the
			output.</li>
	</ul>
	The default value checked is <b>MERGE_TO_SOURCE.</b>
